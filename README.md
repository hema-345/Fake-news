Developed a supervised machine learning pipeline using Python to identify fake news articles from real ones.
• Employed TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction and Logistic Regression for classification, achieving ~95% accuracy on validation
data.
• Preprocessed data using NLTK and Scikit-learn, including stopword removal, stemming, and tokenization for improved model
performance.
• Designed and deployed an interactive Streamlit web application allowing users to input news headlines or articles to verify authenticity
in real-time.
• Serialized and saved trained model using Joblib, ensuring efficient loading and prediction during runtime.
• Integrated user-friendly UI with real-time predictions and visual feedback for educational or journalistic use.
• Performed cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy and avoid overfitting.
• Evaluated model using metrics like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure balanced performance.
• Demonstrated practical applications in media literacy, social media moderation, and automated content verification.
